## 🏡 Airbnb Open Data Analysis

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) project focused on public Airbnb open data. The goal is to identify key trends, pricing patterns, and geographical distributions of listings.

The analysis is documented in the Jupyter Notebook: `Airbnb_Open_Data.ipynb`.

### 🎯 Project Objectives

The notebook performs data cleaning and visualization to answer core business questions:

1.  **Data Quality:** Assess and clean the raw dataset (handling missing values and outliers).
2.  **Pricing Analysis:** Analyze the overall distribution of listing prices and identify factors contributing to high/low prices.
3.  **Geographical Distribution:** Visualize the density and location of listings across different neighborhoods and boroughs.
4.  **Property Correlation:** Examine the relationship between prices, room types, minimum night requirements, and review scores.

### 💻 Technologies & Libraries

* **Python**
* **pandas:** For data loading, cleaning, and manipulation.
* **seaborn:** For high-level statistical data visualization.
* **matplotlib.pyplot:** For creating charts and plots.

### 🚀 Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository.**
2.  **Ensure you have the required dataset** (e.g., a CSV or Excel file containing the Airbnb listing data) available in the project directory.
3.  **Install dependencies** (if not already installed): `pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib`
4.  **Open and run** the `Airbnb_Open_Data.ipynb` notebook in a Jupyter environment to execute the analysis steps.
